    <h2>What is Miso Soup?</h2>
    <p>Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup that starts with a dashi stock and is flavored with miso paste. Dashi is an umami-rich stock made from dried seaweed and dried fish. Miso paste, meanwhile, is a paste made from soybeans, salt, and koji rice.

        The brothy soup usually contains tofu and green onions. It can also feature seaweed, mushrooms, daikon, and more.
